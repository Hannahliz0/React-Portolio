# <My Portfolio>

# Portfolio Website

## Description

This is a personal portfolio website built using React. It showcases my skills, projects, experience, and offers a way for people to contact me.

- **Motivation**: I wanted to create an online presence where potential employers or collaborators could learn more about me, view my work, and reach out.
- **Why did I build this project?**: This project was built to present myself professionally, highlight my skills, and create a platform that I could continuously update as I grow.
- **Problem it solves**: It provides an all-in-one location where visitors can easily learn about my experience and view my completed projects in a structured way. Instead of relying on multiple platforms, this portfolio centralizes everything.
- **What I learned**: I deepened my knowledge of React, routing between multiple pages, and handling form submissions. I also gained experience in organizing project files and deploying a React application.
